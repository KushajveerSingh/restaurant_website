## Dependencies
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Local Setup
**Step 1**. Setup Node.js v16.17.1. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) can be used to quickly setup Node.js (and you can also have multiple versions of Node.js).
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 16.17.1
```

**Step 2**. Clone the repository and install all the dependencies.
```
git clone https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/restaurant_website
cd restaurant_website
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

`--legacy-peer-deps` would install the exact packages as used in the repository. The repository already includes VSCode and Prettier setup, and you can modify the default behavior in `.vscode/settings.json` and `.prettierrc` respectively.

**Step 3**. Create `.env.local` and copy the contents from `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` - set to `http://localhost:3000/` during development and when you deploy the project on Vercel, set it to the domain where the project is hosted.

**Step 4**. Run `make run dev` to start the local development server at `localhost:3000`. Now you can customize the application as per your needs. Further, look at [Directory Setup](#directory-setup) section to understand how the source code is structured.

**Step 5**. After making the desired changes, you can push your project to GitHub and you are ready for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

**Step 6**. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and then click **Add New...** -> **Project** and choose your github repository.

And that is it. You have successfully deployed your custom restaurant website to Vercel.

## Directory Setup
- `public`
    - `favicon.ico` - provide your custom favicon here
    - `manifest.json` - the default behavior allows all the files in the repository to be scrapped by the bots
    - `demo_image.png` - provide your custom logo image here. To be used in the meta tags.
- `src`
    - `global.css` - global css classes are defined here. This file is then loaded in `src/pages/_app.tsx`
    - `data.ts` - provide information like awards, available wines and cocktails on the menu
    - `pages`
        - `_app.tsx` - Used by Next.js to define the default layout for all the pages. You don't need to modify it
        - `_document.tsx` - Used by Next.js to define the default HTML that should be loaded for every page. Provide any custom font here
        - `_index.tsx` - Renders root page `/` and also loads the meta tags from `src/components/MetaTags.tsx`
